# nikolalkc's scripts for game audio in [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/)

  Set of custom REAPER Lua scripts developed specifically for game audio. This will also help to anyone who wants to improve their workflow inside REAPER. 
  
  NOTE: All scripts are for PC, OSX not yet tested. This repository is [Reapack](https://reapack.com/) compatible
  ANOTHER NOTE: This repo is not yet completely user-friendly. When I complete Wiki and some other stuff this line will be removed.
