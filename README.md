## wGroups - Game audio editing scripts for REAPER

wGroups are my own invention. It' short for Wrap Groups. Wraping is a special way of grouping items in one compact and clean container that acts as group. It can be moved, edited, copied and named, just like a normal group, but with benefits of quick exporting and renaming workflow.
