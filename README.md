  For years, I've used ProTools for sound design for short animated films, advertisements and student exercises. I have always been a big fan of ASDG sound editing workflow and today I use such a montage in REAPER. In addition, ProTools had another convenient option that meant a lot to me when I started working on audio for video games. The Clip Group feature. By using clip groups, it is possible to pack multiple clips from several different tracks into a single non-destructive container. This container can be named, moved, edited and copied to other places inside your project.

  However, Protools was never meant for creating a large number of separate sound assets, and that always gave me a frustration. When the studio I work at started developing a new game inside Unreal Engine, my colleagues and I got this book http://gameaudioimplementation.com. In this book, the authors recommended REAPER as their main weapon for sound design for video games, highlighting its favorable price, batch file processing and the possibility of extending DAW's functionality by adding/writing additional scripts and extensions (btw, I highly recommend that book to everyone interested in the subject). From that moment on, my life has changed forever. In less than a month, Protools was in the trashcan, and my new passion and obsession was born. I immediately did my best to customize the workflow inside REAPER to that needed by me and colleagues in the studio, and now I want to share it with everyone. The process of sound design for video games is different from other linear media primarily because it is necessary to prepare a large number of separate sound files that are appropriately named and hierarchically structured inside your game. I hope to introduce a solution to this problem.
